title: Proposal presentations
---

In the last 1.5 weeks of the course, you will be presenting to the class on one of your two proposals. This starts March 30th, and ends April 6th.
John will be organizing the schedule. Your presentation can either be about the proposal you are writing now, or about the one that is already conmplete. 
If you are presenting on the proposal that was already marked, you can update it based on the comments you received. 

The presentations are 10 to 12 minutes long with 3 minutes for questions. After 15 minutes we will have to cut you off due to time constraints. 
Your presentation should have powerpoint slides to go along with it. 

The presentation should be similar to the paper presentations you've been doing in tutorial. It should have the following points:

-Why we care about the topic, why it is interesting.

-Necessary background info including big picture

-The questions and hypothesis

-The methods

-The predicted results and implications.

You should weave this into a cohesive presentation, also try to make it look nice.
