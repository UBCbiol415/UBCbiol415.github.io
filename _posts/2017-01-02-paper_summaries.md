title: How to submit paper summaries
---

Every week you will be submitting a summary for each assigned paper. To make this easy, we're going to use [Google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/).
Please create a document titled "biol415-firstname_lastname" and share it (including editing) with me (dr.gregory.l.owens[at]gmail.com). 
Write all your summaries in this document, **do not create a new document each week**. I will comment and grade within the document itself.

You do not need to email me when you are finished, I will mark the document after the deadline has passed. If your assignment is going to be late and isn't finished by the deadline, write a note in your document saying so. For example, write "NOT DONE" beside the header.
