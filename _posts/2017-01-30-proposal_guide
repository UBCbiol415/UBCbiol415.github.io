The first proposal is due in a month (February 28th). We've now posted the [marking key](/examples/Proposal_1_marking_scheme.pdf). 
We will be marking your proposals directly off this. One idea for significantly improving your grade is to write your proposal ahead of time, trade papers with another student, and mark each others paper based on the key. 
They will be able to see your errors much easier than you can. 

Additionally, I have also posted another [example proposal](/examples/Example_proposal_annotated.pdf), this time with annotation highlighting why it is good.
