title: Proposal two meetings with Greg
---

To help everyone write the best possible proposals, I am requiring that everyone have a meeting with me to talk about their ideas before they write the proposal.
Here is what you need to do:
1. Do some readings and decide on a question.
2. Hash out a quick outline of your backgroung, question, methods and results. For example, complete a preproposal like you did for the previous proposal.
3. Email Greg with a suggested meeting time. The meetings will be 10-30 minutes long, so block out half an hour.
4. Meet with Greg. We will talk about your ideas and I will make suggestions or ask questions about your ideas to help you clarify your plans.

This is a low stress meeting, you aren't being graded on it. 
You must have a meeting by April 1st, so you have time to write the proposal after talking.
